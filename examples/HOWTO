### How to select libraries for a build
#
### 1. Run nm to get a symbol table of every static library
#
# > nm -C *.a | egrep "\.a| T | W | D | R "
#
# .a - name of the library: libgrpc.a, etc.
# T (Text) It's usually a function
# D (Data) It's usually a global or static variable
# W (Weak) The symbol is a weak symbol
# R        Global read-only data symbol
#
# One-line command for all *.a libs to generate *.a.nm files:
# > for file in *.a; do rm -rf $file.nm && nm -C $file | egrep "\.a| T | W | D | R " > $file.nm; done

### 2. Run make command and select a firsts undefined sysbol
#
# > rm -rf client; make client 2>&1 | grep undefined | head -n 1
# > examine_stack.cc:(.text+0x3b): undefined reference to `absl::lts_20230802::Symbolize(void const*, char*, int)'

### 3. Find library that has undefined symbol
#
# > grep absl::lts_20230802::Symbolize *.nm
# > libabsl_symbolize.a.nm:0000000000002730 T absl::lts_20230802::Symbolize(void const*, char*, int)
#
# The corresponding library is libabsl_symbolize.a
#
